# ReyMap
A tool to automate key pressed with a second keyboard (numpad)

This is a place holder.

Stream Deck™️ is a tool which really helps me more productive, but it's very expensive and I find it slightly overkill.
I noticed that most of the stuff I do is limited to:
* Mute microphone
* Mute speakers
* Switch audio
* Accept a call
* Hangup a call
* Turn on/off video

This tool makes this possible with very cheap hardware, a separate usb connected numpad can be had for <10€
