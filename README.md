A tool to automate key pressed with a second keyboard (numpad)

This is a place holder, work in progress, idea brainstorming... etc.

Stream Deck™️ is a tool which really helps me more productive, but it's very expensive and I find it slightly overkill.

I noticed that most of the stuff I do at work is limited to:
* Mute microphone
* Mute speakers
* Switch audio
* Accept a call
* Hangup a call
* Turn on/off video

The issue is that it's not just a key stroke to do this, but the right application needs to be active.
So there is more than just a button triggering a key stroke!

I thought up a way to use a separate usb connected numpad or keyboard, which triggers activities.
This would make some use-cases possible with very cheap hardware, such a numpad can be had for <10€
